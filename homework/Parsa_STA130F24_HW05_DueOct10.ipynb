    "A most beloved piece of [statistical lore](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2012.00620.x) about the (most famous) statistician Ronald Fisher involves cups of tea with milk. Fisher and his friend and colleague, Dr. Muriel Bristol, worked at Cambridge in the 1920s and regularly had tea together. During one of their afternoon tea times, Bristol refused a cup of tea from Fisher because he put milk in first BEFORE pouring in the tea. Bristol said she could taste the difference, and much preferred the taste of tea when the milk was poured in afterward the tea. Fisher didn't think that there could be a difference and proposed a hypothesis test to examine the situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fisher made 8 cups of tea, 4 with milk added in first and 4 with tea added in first, and gave them to Dr. Bristol without her seeing how they were made and she would say if she thought the tea or the milk was poured first. As it turned out, Bristol correctly identified if the tea or milk was poured first for all 8 of the cups. Fisher, being a skeptical statistician wanted to test if this could be happening by chance with Bristol just randomly guessing (or whether there was evidence against an assumption of Bristol just randomly guessing), and subsequently designed a statistical hypothesis test to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you run an experiment like this with students in STA130. You get a random sample of 80 STA130 students to each taste one cup of tea and tell you whether they think the milk or tea was poured first. **Suppose 49 students are able to correctly state which was poured first.** Provide a statistical analysis of this experiment as guided through the following set of questions.\n",
