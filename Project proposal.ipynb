Out of all the 263 available, I want to see which variable best correlates with WELLNESS_subjective_happiness_scale_happy. I will be ranking them based on the absolute value of r.\n","2. Every single variable of type float! (Except WELLNESS_subjective_happiness_scale_happy, which will clearly correlate to itself perfectly). I could do a scatter plot between WELLNESS_subjective_happiness_scale_happy and the best predictors, labelled with the r coefficient. I will also use a histogram displaying the mean, median, and standard deviation of WELLNESS_subjective_happiness_scale_happy, also I will do a box plot.\n","\n","3. For every column c, I will first compare it to WELLNESS_subjective_happiness_scale_happy, and I will calculate the correlation between them. Of course, if a given pair of data has a null entry, I will ignore that row for the purposes of cacluating the correlation.\n","4. I hypothesize DEMO_identity_bipoc will correlate best, and definitely UNIQUE_id will correlate the worst (closest to 0).

I will explore COVID_vaccinated and WORK_feel_appreciated. I will drop rows where either of them have NA. I will draw a scatter plot between them, to visualize their correlation. I will also make histograms for both variables.\n","3. I'll do hypothesis testing, with a null hypothesis of \"The number of vaccines does not affect how appreciated someone feels at work, as in, |r| < 0.2\" and also create a p-value to analyse the evidence against the null hypothesis, with an alpha value of 0.05. I'll also create a line of best fit and also calculate the r value.\n","4. I believe that the correlation will be minimal, however, it will be positive. maybe r = 0.2, and so the null hypothesis will be rejected. And since we have a lot of data, our p-value will be small, meaning strong evidence against the null hypothesis."],"metadata":{"id":"EQ1UEeWPg3uV"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##Analysis 3\n","\n","1. This may the most exciting point of analysis. I want to analyze the correlation between every single column, and visualize this. The question is \"how much variance of variable b is explained by variable c?\"\n","2. I plan to explore every single variable, across all types of data (i.e. categorical, discrete, continuous, binary). I will develop techniques for comparing any two of these types. The type of visualization I will choose is a square, with intensity of color representing |r| from 0 to 1. To avoid making it look messy, I will sort the list of variables in a way which optimises higher values to the upper left, and lower values to the lower right.\n","3. Given two variables, where their types are from S = {int, float, bool}, I will treat them as a number (bool will be 0 and 1), and create a line of best fit by least squared residuals, which will help me create the r value. This is the easy part, the hard part is when one, or two of the variables is categorical. If x is categorical (i.e. in the form x = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) where all x_i are 0 except one), and y is in S, then I will create a hyperplane of best fit using x_i as the input variables. Again, this now allows me to directly create the r value. Even more tricky, is if both x and y are categorical. In which case x = (x_1, ..., x_n), and y = (y_1, ..., y_m). I will create a hyperplane of best fit for each y_i using all x_i, then I will suppose the category of y is the y_i which is maximal. This again helps me directly calculate r. Sidenote: I will try to not drop any null rows, and instead use the method described for two categorical variables, but instead have x_i be anything, and set x_{n+1} to represent whether x is null or not.\n","4. There is a lot of data, approximately 1500 variables, which when squared is very large. This gives us a lot of knowledge for a fairly simple process. I predict that UNIQUE_id will correlate perfectly will every single column, this is trivial given that the UNIQUE_id is unique for any given row, so it is simply a massive categorical variable. This may be considered overfitting, but I do not want to change the data at all, and that includes deleting rows and columns. I will also predict that most pairs of variable will correlate badly with each other (We can do an analysis on which columns are the best predictors in general!) I'm just really excited about this because it allows me to just go at it without any brakes."],"metadata":{"id":"bPFadCR2g4H5"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"bUfNAUPSqi4i"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import pandas as pd\n","df = pd.read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pointOfive/stat130chat130/refs/heads/main/CP/CSCS_data_anon.csv\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"kONv7wnJhXoL","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1730737397753,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":12345,"user":{"displayName":"Parsa Hemmati","userId":"11015276849352587265"}},"outputId":"ce815487-8bd7-419f-e386-aae96ca2de43"},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["<ipython-input-1-f7b058b4a593>:2: DtypeWarning: Columns (408,1001,1002,1006,1007,1008,1080,1113,1115,1116,1117,1118,1119,1120,1121,1124,1125,1126,1127,1128,1213,1214,1215,1216,1217,1218,1342,1343,1344,1345,1346,1347,1348,1349,1390,1391,1393,1463,1549,1552,1555,1558,1561) have mixed types.
